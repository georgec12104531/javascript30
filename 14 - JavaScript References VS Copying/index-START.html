    // console.log('players: ', players, 'team: ', team);
    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    team2 = [...players];
    team2[3] = "George"
    console.log('players: ', players, 'team2: ', team2);

    team3 = players.slice();
    team3[3] = "George";
    console.log('players: ', players, 'team3', team3);

    team4 = [].concat(players);
    team4[3] = "George"
    console.log('players: ', players, 'teame4', team4);

    team5 = [...players];
    team5[3] = "George";

    console.log('players: ', players, 'team5', team5);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    console.log('before', person);


    let george = person;
    george.age = 90;
    console.log('after', person);

    copyObj = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 100});

    const person2 = {...person};
    console.log(person2);

    const gc = {
      name: 'George',
      age: 24, 
      details: {
        website: 'georgecharleschang.com',
        imdbeeg: 'beeg.com'
      }
    }

    JSON.parse(JSON.stringify('{"result":true, "count":42}'))
    //JSON.parse converts string objects into pojo
    //JSON.parse converts object into a string 

    const newGc = Object.assign({}, gc)


    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
